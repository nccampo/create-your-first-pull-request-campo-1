FILE DESCRIPTION: Expectations with the CMSC 100 Course


        For this class, I expect to learn more about web development and to harness my front end development skills which would be beneficial in the future as I step into the industry. Aside from the technical skills, I would also expect to learn communication skills, and camaraderie as we complete our group final project. Hopefully, we get to design and develop useful and efficient web applications.
